When train the adversial examples, I use the famous face recognization model: facenet. And test it on the model: mobile_Face, irse50 and ir152 in a black box attack way.
In order to maintain the scheme's perfomance, I did not modify the raw off plain method and stn net.
Due to limited personal abilities, there may be errors in the project. I hope readers will point out errors so I can correct and learn.
